14:["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base leading-relaxed","children":"The spam protection strategy with temporary emails is straightforward but highly effective. When you encounter an untrusted website, unfamiliar service, or suspicious signup form, use your Temp Mail address instead of your personal email.

This makes it perfect for users who want to protect their privacy immediately without navigating complex account creation processes."}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-base leading-relaxed","children":"The anonymity aspect cannot be overstated.
